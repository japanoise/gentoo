Gentoo configs

## What?
The configuration files on my Gentoo system(s). Of particular interest are the kernelconfigs; one is a general basis for amd64 systems,
which works pretty nicely in VirtualBox - and the other is the one I use on my Thinkpad x200, which as far as I can tell works just as well (better than)
either the stock Debian or stock Void kernels.
